/* There's no need for ';' at the end of code blocks and syntax structures that use them like 'if { ... }', 'for { }'. 'function f { }' etc.

/* a function expression is used inside the statement.
 * Let sayHi = ...; as a value. 
 * It's note a code block, but rather an assigment.
 * The semicolon ';' is recommended at the end of statements, no matter what the value is. 
 * So the semicolon here is not related to the Function Expression itself, it just terminates the statement.
